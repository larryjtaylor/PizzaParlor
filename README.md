## Running Requirements

* find git repository at https://github.com/larryjtaylor/PizzaParlor.git
* edit in text editor of your choice. I used Atom.
* Javascript logic can be found in the js directory on scripts.js
* styling can be found in the css directory on styles.css

## Known Bugs

This current version does not reset the toppings fields between clicks, so if the user decides to add or remove toppings and resubmit, the new date is appended to the old. The fix is in the works..
